🪙 InnoFund — A micro Investment pool for student startups
🚀 Built for Web3SSH 2025 Hackathon
Team Name: Cryptonauts


📌 Overview
InnoFund is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that empowers student startup founders by providing transparent, secure, and trustless funding mechanisms. It enables students to pitch innovative ideas and raise support from individual contributors or investors, all on-chain.

🔐 Our mission: Fuel innovations. Fund dreams.

❓ Problem Statement
Student startup founders often face challenges accessing early-stage funding, especially without prior recognition or credit history. Traditional crowdfunding platforms rely on centralized control, lack transparency, and provide minimal incentive for contributors.

✅ Solution
InnoFund offers a decentralized solution:

📌 Students can post startup ideas directly on-chain.

💰 Contributors can:

Fund ideas as backers (earning badges based on amount).

Invest as sponsors (expecting returns if successful, or refunds if not).

🔗 All data — including projects, user roles, badges, and donations — is stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

⚙️ Tech Stack
🔗 Solidity (Smart Contract)

💻 React.js (Frontend)

🦊 MetaMask (Wallet integration)

🎨 HTML + CSS

💡 Why InnoFund is Unique
Badges as NFT-like reputation markers for backers

Refund + return model for investors (true risk-based support)

Community-focused: enables real students to be supported transparently

🧪 Known Limitations / Challenges

1. Lack of Testnet ETH: We were unable to access Sepolia testnet ETH, which prevented us from deploying and testing live smart contracts. So we simulated it using frontend logic.
2. NFT Minting Limitations: Due to no test ETHt, actual NFT badges couldn’t be minted. Instead, we represented them as styled strings to simulate different badge levels.
3. Backend Constraints: Backend integration with MongoDB was not fully implemented. Profile data and startup listings were visually represented using logo placeholders on the frontend.
4. Blockchain Integration for Beginners: As beginners in Web3 development, connecting React frontend with smart contracts was initially challenging. We overcame this with AI guidance and documentation support.


🏁 Future Scope
DAO-based idea selection

Full backend integration with MongoDB (for analytics and leaderboard)

NFT badges and verified student profiles (linked to institute ID)
